            <h1>Who is Arijkx?</h1>
            I’m a pixel artist – yes, that still exists, and I love creating big art with tiny squares. Here, I present
            some of my creations, inspired by old video games that probably make you as nostalgic as the dust on your
            Gameboy.<br><br>

            My passion lies mainly in futuristic spaceships and epic space battles. Why? Because the universe is just
            way cooler than regular life. For my drawings, I mostly use Aseprite – a program that's probably as fun as a
            space adventure. Before that, I was a loyal Adobe Photoshop user until I realized pixel art involves fewer
            pixels and a lot more fun.<br><br>

            What’s my goal? To offer you artwork that you can enjoy and hopefully use. Now and then, I throw up a free
            asset pack on itch.io, because nothing’s more fun than giving something away and seeing it get used. If you
            like it – great! If not – well, at least it was free.<br><br>

            On the side, I’m also trying, like many other artists, to dip my toes into game development. As a passionate
            gamer (and probably a bit frustrated by the industry), I dream of creating my own game ideas. Yeah, I’m the
            kind of person who thinks they can make a game that isn’t dependent on microtransactions. But hey, these are
            just hobby projects, so no worries – you’ll see more eventually.<br><br>

            I hope my art speaks to you. Or maybe not. But hey, leave a comment and tell me what you think –
            constructive criticism is like good coffee: bitter, but necessary.<br><br>

            Thanks for stopping by – enjoy exploring my pixel art. And if not, feel free to swing by again. Maybe I’ll
            find the “right” pixel someday.<br><br>
