            <p><strong>Last updated: [25.03.2025]</strong></p><br>
            <p style="margin: 0; font-size: 14px;">
                
                    No Cookies, No Problem!<br>
                    <br>
                    There’s no cookie banner here because, frankly, I don’t use cookies.<br><br>
                    Why? Because I honestly couldn’t care less about tracking your data.<br><br>
                    What you do here is about as relevant to me as the weather on Neptune — which is to say, not at all.<br>
                    <p class="size1">Ähhhh - On Neptune, it’s -214°C, 2,000 km/h winds, and zero sun—perfect for jet-powered penguins!</p><br>
                    I store nothing, analyze nothing, track nothing, and snoop around absolutely nothing.<br><br>
                    Your data is your business, and my focus is on pixel art, not profiling.<br>
                    <br>
                    So relax, click around, and enjoy the site — no cookie nonsense involved.<br>
                    <br>
                    P.S.: If you really crave cookies, just bake some.<br>
                    They taste way better than the digital ones anyway.<br>
                    <br><h1>Level System, Quests & Rewards:</h1>
    
                    This website features a Level System, Quest System, and Rewards System that enhance your browsing experience.<br><br>
    
                    <strong>How it works:</strong><br>
                    All data (XP, Level, Gold, Quest Progress, Purchased Rewards) is stored exclusively in your browser's Local Storage.<br><br>
    
                    <strong>Privacy & Data Storage:</strong><br>
                    • No data is sent to any server<br>
                    • No data is stored on external servers<br>
                    • All data remains on your device<br>
                    • We don't collect, track, or analyze any of this data<br><br>
    
                    <strong>Important:</strong><br>
                    Since all data is stored locally in your browser, you will lose all progress (XP, Level, Gold, Quest completions, purchased rewards) if you:<br>
                    • Clear your browser cache completely<br>
                    • Use private/incognito mode (data is cleared when you close the window)<br>
                    • Clear browser data manually<br>
                    • Use a different browser or device<br><br>
    
                    Your progress is tied to your browser and device — it's completely local and private!<br><br>
    
                    <br><h1>hyper-links:</h1>
    
                    Some links on this site will launch you into the vast unknown — aka other websites and social media
                    platforms. <br><br>
                    Once you click and land there, you've officially left the cozy, cookie-free safety of my pixel
                    realm.<br><br>
    
                    I'm not responsible for what those sites do with your data — whether they track you, analyze you, or try
                    to sell you moon boots. <br><br>
                    That's their business, not mine.<br><br>
    
                    So click wisely, explore bravely — and may your data stay safe out there in the wild internet galaxy!
                    <br><br>
                    Stay cool,<br>
                    Your Arijkx<br><br><br>
              </p>
